# Starting kit - LLMs

Some loose ideas: Write a bot that has an interface to arxiv/google scholar and
- reviews papers (maybe using supervised information from OpenReview).
- answers the question "has this idea been done already?"
- given a methods section, writes the related work section.

## Setting up your environment

Create a conda environment and activate it

```bash
conda create -n llms python=3.10
conda activate llms
```

Install the requirements by running
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Afterwards, you can install this package with
```bash
pip install -e .
```
